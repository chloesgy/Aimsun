# Aimsun
Aimsun Codes for reading info(flow, speed, distance, and vehicles), creating MFD and real-time controller.
The codes are written for my thesis by me.

"AAPI.py" is to generate AIMSUN API.
"Discrete PI controller [Aimsun Python API]" represents a discrete proportional-integrate controller according to the macroscopic fundamental diagram based on the theory of perimeter control to mitigate congestion.
